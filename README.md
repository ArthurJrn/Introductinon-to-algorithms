# Introduction-to-algorithms

Python implementation of all algortihms presented in the infamous book by Thomas H. Cornen "Introduction to algorithms."

# Organization of the repository
Algorithms are organized by type: sorting, divide and conquer...
Each type folder is provided with a test file using unittest to test the correctness of the algorithms. To test, just use "python3 -m unittest" on your terminal once you have clone the repository.

# Complexity
Moreover, each folder is provided with a Jupyter Notebook displaying the time complexity of the various algorithms implemented. The complexity of each algorithm is detailed in the book, so I describe the complexity of each algorithm I implement.
